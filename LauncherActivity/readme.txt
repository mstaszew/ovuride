the android app as of 2014-11-26 is very much work in progress due to changes Bell has made to their website recently. 
the application is going to pool the server for data every hour and display results on a widget.
there are modest changes to the code neccessary for it to work, that is setting proper tags to look for with jsoup
and customizing server address. username and password are hard-coded in the .js server file for development.

built-in www server, local versions of the bell login website are obsolete and will be removed.
